📊 Sorting Visualizer (3D)

A 3D Sorting Visualizer web application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work using Three.js animations.
This project helps learners understand sorting algorithms through interactive 3D cube animations, real-time statistics, and step-by-step execution.

📌 About

The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web-based application designed to help students and developers understand sorting algorithms visually.
It represents array elements as 3D cubes and animates comparisons, swaps, and placements in real time.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js, focusing on clean UI, smooth animations, and algorithmic clarity.
Users can control animation speed, step through algorithms manually, and compare algorithm performance using statistics like comparisons and swaps.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals of Data Structures & Algorithms, JavaScript, and 3D graphics programming.

📸 How It Works

Array elements are displayed as 3D cubes

Each sorting step is animated:

🟡 Comparison

🔴 Swap

🟣 Placement

Real-time stats update during execution

Sorting completes with a celebration animation
